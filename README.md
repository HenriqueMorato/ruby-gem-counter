# Ruby Gem Counter

**Ruby Gem Counter** was born to list all Github's repositories that use Ruby, find the `Gemfile` parse it and count which `gems` are used to rank which one is the most used.


## Running with Docker

We are using a simple Docker environment with two images, the application it self and a `Postgres` database.

To run the application just use:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That will start the rails application
